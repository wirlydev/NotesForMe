I have a table of wrestlers and their win/loss record by year. 
I would like to be able to have a table that shows the number of losses each National Champion had for a specified championship year, that would look like this...

| CompetitionYear | Spencer Lee | Nick Suriano |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| 2019        | 3           | 3
