##What am I tryig to accomplish?

I would like to return a table that lists all the D1 Wrestling National Champions for a specified year and the number of losses they have had in their collegiate career. 

The column names should be the wrestler's name and the data row should have the number of losses.

The result should look something like...

|Wrestler 1 Name |Wrestler 2 Name |Wrestler 3 Name | etc. |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|------|
|3			     |5               |0               |5     |

The wrestler who won the National Championship with the most career losses will win the ficticious "Annual Drew Foster Resilience Award". 

##What does the original data look like?

To keep things simple for this example all the data is in a single table that looks like this...

|AthleteName     |Wins  |Losses|CompetitionYear|NationalPlacement|
|----------------|------|------|---------------|-----------------|
|Anthony Ashnault|32    |0     |2019           |1                |
|Bo Nickal       |30    |0     |2019           |1                |
|Drew Foster     |28    |5	   |2019	       |1                |


If you are interested in trying this yourself with the same data here is the sql to create and populate the source table. https://gist.github.com/wirlydev/919178ac61ea57b5315fa29e524eef57

##How do I do this?

Since I want to "pivot" the source table from vertical to horizontal I can use the [TSQL Pivot Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver15)

Here is an example of a sproc that will do the job.

```sql
Alter PROCEDURE GetCareerLosses 
	@CompetitionYear int,
	@NationalPlacement int
AS
BEGIN
	SET NOCOUNT ON;
	
	declare @sql nvarchar(max) = '';
	declare @names nvarchar(max) = '';

	Select @names += QUOTENAME(AthleteName) + ',' from Athletes where CompetitionYear = @CompetitionYear and NationalPlacement = @NationalPlacement order by AthleteName
	Set @names = Left(@names, len(@names) -1)

	set @sql = 'Select * from 
				(Select 
					a1.AthleteName,
					Sum(a1.Losses) Losses
				from Athletes a1 inner join 
					Athletes a2 on (a1.AthleteName = a2.AthleteName)
					where a2.CompetitionYear = @competitionYear and a2.NationalPlacement = @nationalPlacement
					group by a1.AthleteName) as SourceTable
				Pivot (
					Sum(Losses) 
					For AthleteName in (' + @names + ')
					)
				as PivotedTable';

				print @sql

				exec sp_executesql @sql,  N'@competitionYear int, @nationalPlacement int, @names nvarchar(max)', @competitionYear, @nationalPlacement, @names 

END
GO
```

##What is happening here?

If I run the above sproc for the competition year 2019 like...

```sql
exec GetCareerLosses @CompetitionYear= 2019, @NationalPlacement = 1
```

This is the value of the variable @sql

```sql
Select * from 
				(Select 
					a1.AthleteName,
					Sum(a1.Losses) Losses
				from Athletes a1 inner join 
					Athletes a2 on (a1.AthleteName = a2.AthleteName)
					where a2.CompetitionYear = @competitionYear and a2.NationalPlacement = @nationalPlacement
					group by a1.AthleteName) as SourceTable
				Pivot (
					Sum(Losses) 
					For AthleteName in ([Anthony Ashnault],[Anthony Cassar],[Bo Nickal],[Drew Foster],[Jason Nolf],[Mekhi Lewis],[Nick Suriano],[Spencer Lee],[Yianni Diakomihalis],[Zahid Valencia])
					)
				as PivotedTable
```

If I run it for 2018, @sql is this...

```sql
Select * from 
				(Select 
					a1.AthleteName,
					Sum(a1.Losses) Losses
				from Athletes a1 inner join 
					Athletes a2 on (a1.AthleteName = a2.AthleteName)
					where a2.CompetitionYear = @competitionYear and a2.NationalPlacement = @nationalPlacement
					group by a1.AthleteName) as SourceTable
				Pivot (
					Sum(Losses) 
					For AthleteName in ([Bo Nickal],[Jason Nolf],[Kyle Snyder ],[Michael Macchiavello],[Seth Gross],[Spencer Lee],[Vincenzo Joseph],[Yianni Diakomihalis],[Zahid Valencia],[Zain Retherford])
					)
				as PivotedTable

```

###Source Table

The subquery that populates the Source Table and provides the input for the pivot operator is this...

```sql
	Select 
					a1.AthleteName,
					Sum(a1.Losses) Losses
				from Athletes a1 inner join 
					Athletes a2 on (a1.AthleteName = a2.AthleteName)
					where a2.CompetitionYear = @competitionYear and a2.NationalPlacement = @nationalPlacement
					group by a1.AthleteName
```

So for example if we run it for 2019 we get... 

|AthleteName	 |Losses|
|----------------|------|
|Anthony Ashnault|22    |
|Anthony Cassar	 |11    |
|Bo Nickal	     |5     |
|Drew Foster	 |44    |
|Jason Nolf		 |4     |
|Mekhi Lewis	 |4     |
|Nick Suriano	 |7     |
|Spencer Lee	 |5     |
|Yianni Diakomihalis|1  |
|Zahid Valencia	 |5     |


###Pivot Operator

Inside the pivot operator we are specifying the aggregation operator that will be populating the data rows.

```sql
Sum(Losses)
```

And the new list of values that data will be calculated for and which will be pivoted to column names.

```sql
For AthleteName in (' + @names + ')
```

Without dynamic sql we would need to manually update the query with the list of names for the competition year we are querying.
So to determine next years Annual Drew Foster Resilience Award winner without dynamic sql we would need to manually change the @names variable with the current years national champions.

###Grouping

In this example there are no colums returned in the source table that are not either part of the aggregate calculation or part of the column values being pivoted to column names.

If there were, then the results would be automatically grouped by thos columns as well.

SO for example if the source table was changed to 

```sql
Select * from 
				(Select
					a2.CompetitionYear, 
					a1.AthleteName,
					Sum(a1.Losses) Losses
				from Athletes a1 inner join 
					Athletes a2 on (a1.AthleteName = a2.AthleteName)
					where a2.CompetitionYear >= @competitionYear and a2.NationalPlacement = @nationalPlacement
					group by a2.CompetitionYear, a1.AthleteName) as SourceTable
				Pivot (
					Sum(Losses) 
					For AthleteName in ([Bo Nickal],[Jason Nolf],[Kyle Snyder ],[Michael Macchiavello],[Seth Gross],[Spencer Lee],[Vincenzo Joseph],[Yianni Diakomihalis],[Zahid Valencia],[Zain Retherford])
					)
				as PivotedTable
```

where we added the a2.CompetitionYear column to the source table that is passed into the pivot operator and changed the CompetitionYear comparison operator from  = to >= and ran the sproc for 2019 like shown above we get back the following results. 

<div style="width: 100%; overflow-x:auto;">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CompetitionYear</th>
<th>Bo Nickal</th>
<th>Jason Nolf</th>
<th>Kyle Snyder</th>
<th>Michael Macchiavello</th>
<th>Seth Gross</th>
<th>Spencer Lee</th>
<th>Vincenzo Joseph</th>
<th>Yianni Diakomihalis</th>
<th>Zahid Valencia</th>
<th>Zain Retherford</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2018</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>36</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2018</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>NULL</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

As you can see ther are a bunch of nulls where the wrestler didn't win a National Championship for that year.
Not really useful for this example but if you see a bunch of nulls in your results make sure that you are not passing in additonal columns to the Pivot Operator. 

##More Info

Nothing above is new information and there are plenty of similar explanations online.
The goal of writing this in my own words with my own example was to ingrain the concepts in my head and provide a place future me to refer to.   

Below are a few additonal resources that do a good good explaining more or less the same thing.
